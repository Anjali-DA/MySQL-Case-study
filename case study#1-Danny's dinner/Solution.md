**Bonus Questions**

**1. The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.**
``` SQL 
select sales.customer_id, sales.order_date, menu.price,menu.product_name,
case 
when members.join_date<=sales.order_date then 'Y'
else 'N'
end as members
from dannys_dinner.sales as sales
left join dannys_dinner.menu as menu
on sales.product_id=menu.product_id
left join dannys_dinner.members as members
on sales.customer_id= members.customer_id;
```
