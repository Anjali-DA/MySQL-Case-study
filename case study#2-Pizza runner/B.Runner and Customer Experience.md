**Ans**: Runners signed up for each 1 week period:
- In week 1 & week 3, one runner signed up
- In week 2, two runners signed up

**âš¡2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
``` SQL
select r.runner_id as each_runner, avg(extract(minute from r.pickup_time)) as avg_pickup_time
from pizza_runner.runner_orders as r
group by runner_id;
```
